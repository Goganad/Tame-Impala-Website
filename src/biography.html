            Tame Impala is a psychedelic music project of 
            Australian multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.
            In the recording studio, Parker writes, records, performs, 
            and produces all of the project's music. As a touring act, 
            Tame Impala consists of Parker (guitar, vocals), Dominic Simper 
            (guitar, synthesiser), Jay Watson (synthesiser, vocals, guitar), 
            Cam Avery (bass guitar, vocals), and Julien Barbagallo (drums, vocals). 
            The group has a close affiliation with fellow Australian psychedelic 
            rock band Pond, sharing members and collaborators, including Nick Allbrook, 
            formerly a live member of Tame Impala. Originally signed to Modular Recordings,
            Tame Impala is now signed to Interscope Records in the US, and Fiction 
            Records in the UK.

            Parker originally conceived the project in Perth in 2007. 
            After a series of singles and EPs, Tame Impala's debut studio album, 
            Innerspeaker, was released in 2010; it was certified gold in Australia 
            and well received by critics. Parker's 2012 follow-up, Lonerism, was 
            also acclaimed, reaching platinum status in Australia and receiving a 
            Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. 
            Tame Impala's third album, Currents, was released in July 2015,and 
            like its predecessor, it won ARIA Awards for Best Rock Album and Album 
            of the Year. Parker won the APRA Award for Song of the Year 2016 for 
            Currents' first track, "Let It Happen". The fourth and most recent 
            studio album, The Slow Rush, was released 14 February 2020.
